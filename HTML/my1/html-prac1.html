          The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, 
          is an important contribution to the popularity of many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. 
          Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), 
          videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). 
          In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs. 
          Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.</p>
